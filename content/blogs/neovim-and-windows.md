# PREFACE
One day I got a random video from **The Primeagen** on my youtube feed. Little did I know that this will lead to me ditching ~~Visual Studio Code~~ and ~~Visual Studio~~ **Neovim**.

# GENISIS
The video of **The Primeagen** I was referring to was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE). I still think what was I thinking when using ~~vscode~~, if you guessed NOTHING then you are right. I never did thought about anything when I was using that software all the reasearch I did was my friend said you wanna do web-development install ~~vscode~~ and start developing. This lead to lots of gaps in my knowledge in regards to HOW my tool works same as my knowledge regarding ~~C++~~ build systems **SKILL ISSUES WITH FOOT GUNS**. Which is one of the main reason I started using [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/).
