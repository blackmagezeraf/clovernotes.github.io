# PREFACE
One day I got a random video from **The Primeagen** on my youtube feed. Little did
I know that this will lead to me ditching ~~Visual Studio Code~~ and ~~Visual Studio~~ **Neovim**.

# GENISIS
The video of `The Primeagen` I was referring to was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).\
I still think what was I thinking when using ~~vscode~~, if you guessed NOTHING then you are right. I \
never did thought about anything when I was using that software all the reasearch I did was my friend \
said you wanna do web-development install ~~vscode~~ and start developing.
